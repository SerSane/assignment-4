# Portfolio Website - Feras Alharbi

A modern, responsive portfolio website showcasing my work as a Computer Science student passionate about AI and Cybersecurity. This project demonstrates my web development skills, built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring dynamic content and sophisticated user interactions.

## Project Description

I developed this portfolio website from scratch using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project features comprehensive functionality that meets all Assignment 3 requirements, including GitHub API integration and performance optimizations:

### Core Features
- **Responsive Design**: I implemented a fully responsive layout optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Built an intelligent theme toggle system with persistent user preferences stored in localStorage
- **Dynamic Content**: Developed time-based personalized greetings and an interactive project filtering system
- **GitHub API Integration**: Integrated GitHub REST API to dynamically fetch and display my latest repositories
- **Form Validation**: Created a comprehensive contact form with real-time validation, auto-save, and user feedback
- **Performance Optimizations**: Implemented lazy loading, script deferring, and DOM query caching for faster load times
- **Loading States**: Designed professional loading animations and comprehensive error handling throughout the application
- **Smooth Animations**: Added elegant transitions, hover effects, and scroll-triggered animations

### Sections
- **Hero**: Implemented dynamic time-based greeting system that changes based on time of day
- **About Me**: Personal introduction section with interactive elements
- **Projects**: Built a filterable project showcase with expandable details and tech stack tags
- **Latest GitHub Projects**: Integrated GitHub API to automatically fetch and display my 6 most recently updated repositories
- **Skills**: Organized technical skills by category with a modern card layout
- **Daily Inspiration**: Created a quote system using a local array that randomly selects inspirational quotes
- **Contact**: Developed a dual-section contact area with information display and a fully functional contact form

## Development Process

I developed this portfolio website independently, using AI tools as an assistant to accelerate learning and development. Throughout the project, I made all design decisions, implemented features, and customized code to meet my specific requirements.

### My Development Approach
- **Architecture & Planning**: I designed the overall structure and feature set
- **Implementation**: I wrote all code, integrating AI suggestions where helpful
- **Customization**: I adapted and refined AI-generated code to fit my design vision
- **Testing & Debugging**: I tested all functionality and resolved issues independently
- **Performance**: I implemented optimizations based on best practices

### AI Assistance (Learning Tool)

During development, I used AI tools to help with learning and problem-solving:

- **Learning Guidance**: AI helped explain complex concepts like async/await, fetch API, and error handling
- **Code Suggestions**: Used AI for boilerplate code patterns, which I then customized for my needs
- **Debugging Help**: AI assisted with identifying and fixing errors
- **Best Practices**: AI provided suggestions for code organization and optimization, which I evaluated and implemented

**AI Tools Used:**
- **Cursor AI Assistant**: Used for code suggestions, explanations, and debugging assistance

**For detailed documentation of AI usage, modifications, and learning outcomes, see [docs/ai-usage-report.md](docs/ai-usage-report.md)**

## Key Features I Implemented

### Dynamic & Interactive Elements
- **Time-based Personalization**: I built a greeting system that changes based on current time with custom messaging
- **Project Filtering System**: Developed a filtering system that allows users to filter projects by technology category with smooth animations
- **Expandable Content**: Created expandable project details that show/hide additional information on demand
- **Real-time Form Validation**: Implemented comprehensive validation with instant feedback as users type
- **Auto-save Functionality**: Built an auto-save feature using localStorage to prevent form data loss
- **GitHub API Integration**: Integrated GitHub REST API to fetch and display my latest repositories with loading and error states

### Data Management
- **LocalStorage Integration**: Implemented persistent storage for theme preferences and form drafts
- **Form Submission Handling**: Created a simulated backend communication system with loading states and error handling
- **API Error Handling**: Built robust error handling for GitHub API calls including rate limit detection

### User Experience Enhancements
- **Responsive Design**: Designed and optimized layouts for all screen sizes using mobile-first approach
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Implemented a seamless theme switching system using CSS custom properties
- **Loading States**: Created professional loading spinners and animations throughout the application
- **Error Handling**: Designed user-friendly error messages with clear guidance
- **Performance Optimization**: Implemented lazy loading for images, script deferring, and DOM query caching
- **Accessibility**: Used semantic HTML, ensured keyboard navigation, and added proper ARIA labels

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup and structure
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with custom properties, Grid, and Flexbox
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**: No frameworks - pure JavaScript implementation
